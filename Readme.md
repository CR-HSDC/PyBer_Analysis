# PyBer Analysis

### **Overview of PyBer Analysis**
The purpose of this PyBer analysis, is to assess business metrics from the period of 01/01/2019 to 04/29/19. Data is analyzed to provide insight into PyBer business operations. 
	

*  Ride sharing data is assessed under the following categories:
  	1. Total Rides by location type
  	2. Total drivers by location type
  	3. Total fares by location type 
  	4. Average fare per ride by location type 
  	5. Average fare per driver by location type 


* Additionally, fare totals are summarised in *Figure 2* to provide an overall view of PyBer performance and weekly variations, across the Rural, Suburban and Urban location types.

These findings are discussed within the "PyBer Analysis Results" section below.


### **PyBer Analysis Results**

The results of the updated analysis are summarized in in *Figure 1* to *Figure 9*. Results are discussed below these figures.

**_Figure 1_:** Statistics Summary

  * **Total Rides by Location Type:**
  	* Per *Figure 1*  Urban locations have the highest number of rides, for the period of analysis, at 1,625; Rural locations have the least at 125.

  * **Total Drivers by Location Type:**
  	* Per *Figure 1* Urban locations have the highest number of drivers, for the period of analysis, at 2,405; Rural locations have the least at 78.
  		
  * **Total Fares by Location Type:**
  	* Per *Figure 1* Urban locations have the highest total of fares, for the period of analysis, at $39,854.38; Rural locations have the least at $4,327.93.
  		
  * **Average Fare per Ride by Location Type:**
  	* Per *Figure 1* Rural locations have the highest average fare per ride, for the period of analysis, at $34.62; Urban locations have the least at $24.53
  * **Average Fare per Driver by Location Type:** 
  	* Per *Figure 1* Rural locations have the highest average fare per driver, for the perdio of analysis, at $55.49; Urban locations have the least at $16.57

**_Figure 2_:** Weekly Total Fares by Location Type

  * **Weekly Total Fares by Location Type:** 
  	* Per *Figure 2* Urban locations are have consistently the highest total fares collected. Rural locations have consistently the lowest total number of fares. All three locations exhibit significant weekly variations.


### **PyBer Analysis Summary**

Based upon the above results, 3 recommendations are made to PyBer:

1. From *Figure 1*, Drivers to Rides ratio may be calculated as Average Fare per Driver / Average Fare per Ride. This is 1.6 (=$55.49/$34.62) for Rural locations and 0.66 (=$16.57/$24.53) for urban locations. This suggests that, realtive to market size, each driver is completing more trips for Rural locations than for Urban locations. This may also suggest a shortage of drivers in Rural locations, limiting potential revenue (also evidenced by Rural locations having the lowest total fares amount). This should be further investigated, to verify if efforts to increase driver recruitement for Rural locations would increase overall revenue and profitability. Assessing cancelled or non fulfilled rides may also provide meaningul insight, as extended wait times could be a primary indicator of driver shortage.

2. From *Figure 2*, it can be seen that all 3 location types exhibit a peak in late February. Such periodic peaks should be investigated further to verify if there is a correlation. For example, this late Febrarury peak may conincide with the Superbowl and increased realiance on PyBer services. If driver shortages are observed, via additional analsyis, it should be investigated if futher incentives should be provided to drivers to increase overall revenue for these periods.

3.  From *Figure 1* and similar to the assessment in (1) above, the Drivers to Rides ratio for Suburban locations is 1.27. Expanding the available driver fleet should also be explored for these locations. This analysis may be best executed on a city-by-city basis since there will be variation among the suburban locations (e.g. different number of drivers and riders for each one). Assessing this ratio for each location can highlight which areas would best benefit from increased driver recruitement efforts. Furthermore, analysis of total rides over months, and years may be analyzed to observe growth in particular areas. Growth of rides (e.g. new housing developments) may suggest to increase driver recruitment efforts.
